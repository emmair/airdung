airdung2 is a packet generation tool for testing the IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n specification.

At this time, there are five different packet type/subtypes available with some fields
that are customizable. Default values for the packets are summarized at the end of this 
document, for details on all fields refer to airdung.h.

airdung2 is dependent on the wifi chipset and drivers used. See notes in docs for best 
practices.
