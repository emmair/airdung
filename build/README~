pktSend (Version 0.1.0 beta)

General
-------

pktSend is a linux utility to build custom 802.11 packets and send them to a network 
interface (as a raw socket). 

Currently pktSend only supports three modes of operation: 

  Mode 1: IEEE 802.11 Probe request packet

  Mode 2: IEEE 802.11 Null Data Packet

  Mode 3: IEEE 802.11 Data Packet

pktSend options:

  -i <interface>  specifies the network interface that will be used for sending packets.

  -x <channel>  specifies the channel to send the packet on. This can be any valid channel 
  supported by the wireless LAN network card and driver. 

  -t <dwell time (ms)> specifies the time, in milli-seconds, between each packet sent. This 
  allows the user to control the rate at which packets are sent.

  -m <mode> specifies the modes of operation (described above).

  -r <rate (Mb/s)> specifies the data rate, in Mb/s, of the transmitted packet. Note that 
  certain packet types, such as control and management, can only be sent at certain data 
  rates (1Mb/s). All other packets can be sent at any data-rate supported by the wireless 
  LAN card and driver.
 
  -h   displays the help page.

  -sa <XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX> specifies the source MAC address of the packet. 

  -d <XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX> specifies the destination MAC address of the packet. 

  -b <XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX> specifies the bssid of the packet. 

  -ssid specifies the ssid of the network (probe request only).

Examples
--------

  pktSend -i ath1 -m 1 -sa 00:11:22:33:44:55 -x 9 -bssid testing -t 1000

  will send a probe request packet on channel 9, interface ath1 with an ssid 
  called "testing" and a source MAC address of 00:11:22:33:44:55. The bssid and
  destination address will both be ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff (broadcast). The rate will
  be 1 pkt/second and the data rate will default to 1 Mb/s.

  pktsend -i ath1 -m 2 -sa 00:11:22:33:44:55  -d 00:22:22:22:22:22 \ 
       -b bb:bb:bb:bb:bb:bb:bb -x 9 -r 11 -t 200

  will send a null data packet on channel 9, interface ath1 at a rate of 5
  pkts/sec and a data rate of 11Mb/s. The source MAC address is 00:11:22:33:44:55,
  the destination MAC address is 00:22:22:22:22:22 and bssid is bb:bb:bb:bb:bb:bb.


Packet Content
--------------

Mode 1

  When mode 1 is selected it will send a broadcast probe request packet with a default 
  source MAC address of bb:bb:bb:bb:bb:bb.

Mode 2

  When mode 2 is selected it will send a standard IEEE 802.11 null data packet.

Mode 3

  When mode 3 is selected it will send a NetBIOS data packet.


In all cases the default BSSID and destination address is ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff (broadcast).


Appendix A: Monitor mode HOW-TO
-------------------------------

This section describes how to get a wireless LAN NIC card into monitor mode (the state 
necessary for pktSend to function properly).

Note: At the time of writing of this document, the only verified driver is the Atheros 
Madwifi driver version 0.9.4.

	1) Verify that you are using Madwifi version 0.9.4 (check this with the dmesg command)
   	2) Type the following:
	
		wlanconfig ath create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode monitor

This will return with an interface with the name athX where “X” is the next higher number of 
your normal Atheros interface. Take note of this interface number since you will be using it 
as your outgoing interface.

   	3) Issue the pktSend command:

		pktSend -i ath1 -x 9 -m 1 -t 200

 
	4) After you are finished, you may need to take down the virtual AP by typing the 
	following:

		wlanconfig athX destroy 

	where: athX is the virtual AP that was created in step 2).
